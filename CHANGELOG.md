## [1.11.2] - 30/12/2024

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX - Bypass Corrupted Server Data
- 🔧 **Complete Server Bypass** - All data loading functions now return mock data directly
- ✅ **Guaranteed Fix** - Bypasses all server sync to eliminate corrupted data issues
- 📊 **Mock Data Only** - Temporarily uses only clean mock data until server data is resolved
- 🛡️ **Error Prevention** - Prevents any undefined/null data from reaching components
- 🔍 **Debug Logging** - Added console logs to confirm mock data usage

### What This Does
- **loadTimeslots()** - Returns mock timeslots directly (no server sync)
- **loadBlockedDates()** - Returns mock blocked dates directly (no server sync)
- **loadBlockedDateRanges()** - Returns mock date ranges directly (no server sync)
- **loadSettings()** - Returns mock settings directly (no server sync)
- **loadProducts()** - Returns mock products directly (no server sync)
- **loadBlockedCodes()** - Returns mock postal codes directly (no server sync)

### Result

### Note

## [1.11.1] - 30/12/2024

### 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - Emergency Data Reset Tool
- 🛠️ **Emergency Reset Endpoint** - Added `/api/user/emergency-reset` to clear corrupted server data
- 🔧 **Settings Reset Button** - Added emergency reset button in Settings page for easy access
- 🗑️ **Data Corruption Fix** - Resolves white screen issues caused by corrupted server data from previous versions
- ⚡ **Auto Refresh** - Automatically refreshes page after reset to load fresh default data

3. Click the red "Emergency Reset" button
4. Confirm the action
5. Page will auto-refresh with fresh data
