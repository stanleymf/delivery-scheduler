# üö® SHOPIFY FEE HANDLING - TECHNICAL LIMITATION & SOLUTIONS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **THE CORE PROBLEM**
**Shopify does NOT allow dynamic pricing on line items via the Cart API.**

When you add a product to cart, it uses the **fixed price** set in the product admin. You cannot change the price dynamically through JavaScript.

---

## üîç **WHY YOUR FEE SHOWS $0.00**

1. **Fee product created** with $0.00 price ‚úÖ
2. **Widget adds product** to cart ‚úÖ  
3. **Cart shows $0.00** because that's the product's actual price ‚ùå
4. **Line item properties** are just metadata - they don't affect pricing ‚ùå

---

## üí° **PROPER SOLUTIONS**

### **SOLUTION 1: MULTIPLE FEE PRODUCTS** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

Create separate products for each fee amount:

```
Products to Create:
- Express Delivery Fee $15 (handle: express-delivery-fee-15)
- Express Delivery Fee $25 (handle: express-delivery-fee-25)  
- Express Delivery Fee $35 (handle: express-delivery-fee-35)
```

**Widget automatically selects the right product:**
```javascript
// Widget finds the correct fee product
const feeHandle = `express-delivery-fee-${feeAmount}`;
const response = await fetch(`/products/${feeHandle}.json`);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Correct cart totals** immediately
- ‚úÖ **No manual processing** needed
- ‚úÖ **Professional checkout** experience
- ‚úÖ **Works with all Shopify plans**

---

### **SOLUTION 2: CART NOTES + MANUAL PROCESSING** üî∂ **CURRENT FALLBACK**

**How it works:**
1. Widget saves fee info to cart notes
2. Order appears with fee details in notes
3. **You manually add fee** to order in Shopify admin
4. Customer gets invoice with correct total

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
// Widget adds to cart notes:
--- EXPRESS DELIVERY FEE ---
Amount: $25
Timeslot: Express 2-4pm
Date: 15/12/2024
--- END FEE INFO ---
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Works immediately** with current setup
- ‚úÖ **No additional products** needed
- ‚úÖ **Complete fee information** captured

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå **Manual work** required per order
- ‚ùå **Cart total incorrect** during checkout
- ‚ùå **Customer confusion** about final price

---

### **SOLUTION 3: SHOPIFY SCRIPTS/FUNCTIONS** üî∂ **ADVANCED**

**Requirements:** Shopify Plus subscription

**How it works:**
1. Widget saves fee info as cart attributes
2. **Shopify Scripts** automatically apply fees at checkout
3. Customer sees correct total at checkout

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully automated** fee application
- ‚úÖ **Professional** checkout experience
- ‚úÖ **No manual work** required
- ‚úÖ **Complex fee logic** supported

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå **Shopify Plus required** ($2000+/month)
- ‚ùå **Complex setup** required

---

### **SOLUTION 4: DRAFT ORDERS** üî∂ **ENTERPRISE**

**How it works:**
1. Widget creates draft order with fees included
2. Customer redirected to draft order checkout
3. Fees automatically included in total

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete control** over pricing
- ‚úÖ **Correct totals** from start
- ‚úÖ **Professional** experience

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå **Complex implementation**
- ‚ùå **Different checkout flow**

### **Option C: Shopify Plus Upgrade**
1. Upgrade to Shopify Plus
2. Implement Shopify Functions for automatic fees
