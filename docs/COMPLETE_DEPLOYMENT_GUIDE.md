- `https://your-worker-url.com/widget.js`

### Logs & Debugging

```bash
# Railway logs
railway logs

# Cloudflare Worker logs
wrangler tail

# Local development
pnpm dev
wrangler dev
```

### Updates & Maintenance

```bash
# Update version
pnpm version:patch  # or minor/major

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use Railway and Cloudflare secret management
- Rotate tokens regularly

### 2. API Security
- Use HTTPS for all endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all inputs

### 3. Shopify Security
- Use minimal required permissions
- Monitor webhook security
- Validate webhook signatures
